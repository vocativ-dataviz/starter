# Vocativ Interactive Infographic Template

A lightweight starting point to create websites, especially data visualization mini-sites. (That's my job!)

jQuery, D3, and Underscore are included. [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) is used for CSS.

I've focused on sane defaults (for me) and little else, so it can be the starting point for as many projects as possible with little to no modification.
